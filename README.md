I’m a product-focused data analyst with a foundation in finance, e-commerce, and consumer behavior — currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at USC Marshall. My work blends rigorous statistical modeling with product strategy to answer high-impact questions:  

**What drives user churn?**  
**How do we unlock monetization through smarter segmentation or pricing?**  
**Where are the hidden inefficiencies in customer journeys, funnels, or campaigns?**  

Whether it’s forecasting revenue for the LA Clippers, identifying $50M growth corridors at HSBC, or optimizing digital journeys at Unilever and Seamoney, I specialize in connecting raw data to decisions that matter.

## What I Work On

**Product Analytics**  
Feature performance, funnel optimization, offer testing, and user segmentation — driven by SQL, Python, and experimentation frameworks.

**AI + NLP for Product Intelligence**  
LLM-powered insight extraction from user feedback and surveys. I’ve applied GenAI to grief response mapping, content toxicity, and insurance risk classification.

**Monetization Strategy**  
Price sensitivity analysis, behavioral segmentation, and churn diagnostics — with roots in enterprise finance and retail/e-commerce growth.

**Visualization for Influence**  
From Power BI sales forecasts to executive-ready dashboards, I translate complex signals into stories that move strategy forward.
