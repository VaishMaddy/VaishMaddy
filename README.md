I'm a product-focused data scientist and analyst focused on understanding users and informing what teams build next. I have an MS in Business Analytics at USC Marshall and work end-to-end, from SQL analysis and A/B tests to ML and NLP systems.

**My Work Spans:**
- **Product Analytics**: Metrics definition, funnel optimization, cohort analysis, and retention diagnostics
- **Experimentation & Causal Inference**: A/B testing, quasi-experiments, and incrementality measurement
- **User Segmentation**: Clustering and behavioral modeling for personalization and targeting
- **ML in Production**: NLP, classification, regression, and RAG systems for business problems
- **Data Infrastructure**: ETL pipelines, dashboards, and analytics tooling at scale

I've worked across B2B SaaS, banking, fintech, and consumer products, answering questions like: *What’s driving churn? How do we price this feature? Which segments actually move revenue?*

## What I've Worked On

### Product Analytics & Business Intelligence
Built real-time dashboards (SQL, Power BI, Tableau) tracking KPIs like CAC, LTV, conversion funnels, and cohort retention. Conducted deep-dive analyses on user behavior to inform product roadmaps and GTM strategy.

### A/B Testing & Experimentation
Designed and analyzed quasi-experiments to measure incrementality in pricing, promotions, and feature launches. Applied statistical hypothesis testing and causal inference to validate impact on activation, engagement, and revenue.

### User Segmentation & Personalization
Applied clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) and behavioral feature engineering to segment users for targeted campaigns, dynamic pricing, and content recommendations.

### Machine Learning for Product
Built ML systems including RAG-based compliance tools (AWS Bedrock), toxicity classifiers (BERT, XGBoost), and zero-inflated regression for insurance pricing. Focus on interpretability and business impact.

## Featured Projects

### [Duolingo User Segmentation & Growth Strategy](https://github.com/VaishMaddy/Duolingo-User-Segmentation)
**Behavioral clustering for retention & monetization**
Applied K-means clustering on engagement metrics (session frequency, streak consistency, completion rates) to segment users into distinct learner personas. Generated persona-specific retention playbooks and subscription targeting strategies. *Tech: Python, Scikit-Learn, feature engineering, clustering.*

### [Google Ads Policy RAG System](https://github.com/VaishMaddy/Google-Ads-Financial-Policy-RAG)
**Production-ready retrieval-augmented generation for compliance**
Built a policy-grounded RAG system on AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5, Titan embeddings) achieving 100% correctness on financial advertising compliance questions. Evaluated 8 embedding-chunking-LLM configurations with strict safety guardrails. *Tech: Amazon Bedrock, S3, LLMs, vector retrieval.*

### [Toxic Comment Classification](https://github.com/VaishMaddy/Toxic-Comment-Classification-NLP)
**Fairness-aware NLP for content moderation**
Developed 4 ML models (BERT, RoBERTa, LSTM, XGBoost) to automate toxicity detection on Wikipedia comments, achieving 94.4% accuracy. Uncovered bias: race/gender-related comments were 20-30% more likely to be flagged as toxic. *Tech: HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, NLP.*

### [Insurance Loss Modeling](https://github.com/VaishMaddy/Insurance-Loss-Modeling)
**Zero-inflated regression for claims prediction**
Built ETL pipeline for 37K+ insurance policies, engineered risk features (vehicle risk score, premium-to-value ratio), and trained 4 models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Neural Network), improving claim cost prediction by 22%. *Tech: Python, Scikit-Learn, regression, feature engineering.*

### [Uber Demand Optimization (NYC)](https://github.com/VaishMaddy/Uber-Ride-Demand-Python-Analysis)
**Spatial clustering & regression for marketplace optimization**
